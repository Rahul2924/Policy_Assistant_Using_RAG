 📚 Study Notes Assistant (RAG + Groq + Streamlit)

An AI-powered **Study Notes Assistant** that helps students revise and understand their own notes.

Upload your lecture notes as text files, and the chatbot will:
- summarize them,
- explain concepts in simple language,
- answer questions based on your notes,
- and optionally fall back to general knowledge.

## 🎯 Use Case Objective

Many students:
- have lots of scattered notes,
- struggle to revise large content,
- find it hard to quickly recall definitions or key concepts before exams.

This app acts as a **personal study assistant**:
- You upload your notes,
- ask questions in normal language,
- and get answers grounded in the uploaded documents.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Upload your study notes** (`.txt`, `.md`)  
- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  - Notes are chunked and embedded using sentence-transformers  
  - Stored in a FAISS vector index  
  - Relevant chunks are retrieved when you ask a question
- 🤖 **Groq LLM integration**  
  - Uses a Groq-hosted LLaMA model to generate answers
- 🎛 **Response modes**  
  - **Concise** → 2–3 sentence short answers  
  - **Detailed** → deeper explanation + revision bullet points
- 💬 **Chat-style interface**  
  - Conversation history visible as chat bubbles
- 🧹 **Utility buttons**  
  - Clear Knowledge Base (reset all indexed notes)  
  - Clear Chat History

1️⃣ Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

2️⃣ Create virtual environment
python -m venv chatbotvenv
chatbotvenv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Set your environment variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
# Optional:
# SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here


⚠️ Never commit .env to Git. It should be in .gitignore.

▶️ Running the App Locally
chatbotvenv\Scripts\activate
streamlit run app.py


Then open your browser at:

http://localhost:8501

🧠 How It Works (RAG Flow)

Upload Notes

User uploads .txt / .md files from the sidebar.

Each file is split into overlapping chunks.

Embeddings & Indexing

Chunks are passed through sentence-transformers to get embeddings.

Embeddings + metadata are stored in a FAISS index (vectors/ folder).

Question Answering

When the user asks a question:

The question is embedded.

Top-K similar chunks are retrieved from FAISS.

A prompt is built with:

Student question

Retrieved document context

Optional web search summary

Response mode (Concise / Detailed)

The prompt is sent to Groq LLM (call_llm), and response is shown in the UI.

Modes

Concise → short, focused answer for quick revision.

Detailed → full explanation with revision bullet points.

🌐 Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

Push your code to GitHub (without chatbotvenv/ or .env).

On Streamlit Cloud
:

Create a new app

Point to your GitHub repo and app.py

Set secrets in App → Settings → Secrets:

GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_key_here"
# SERPAPI_KEY = "your_serpapi_key_here"


Deploy ✅
🚧 Limitations & Future Improvements

Currently supports plain text (.txt, .md); PDF/DOCX support can be added via parsers.

No per-user authentication or persistent cloud DB yet.

Web search feature is optional and depends on SerpAPI key.

Possible enhancements:

PDF / DOCX lecture notes support

User login & saved workspaces

“Quiz mode” – auto-generate questions from notes

Export summaries/flashcards

# Policy_Assistant_Using_RAG
An intelligent, AI-powered assistant designed to query internal policy documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This system allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive accurate, context-aware answers derived directly from uploaded PDFs or text-based policies, reducing reliance on manual document searching.
